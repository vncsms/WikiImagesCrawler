# WikiImagesCrawler

- Install MongoDB
- Install Pypy

  `pip install pymongo`
 
  `pip install requests`
  
  `pip3 install beautifulsoup4`
  
- This algorithm will list in mongo all images from wikipedia from the articles you want. But if you need all articles you should executable in multiples tmux.
- Maybe will take a few weeks to crawl all articles.
- The `cont0.txt` file will be necessary to not repeat articles.
